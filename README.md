IAES Research Data and Code Repository

This repository contains data and R code used in the study titled "Prospects and Complexities of Global Bioenergy Deployment Using Agroforestry Residues for Advancing Sustainable Development". The Integrated AFRs to Energy System (IAES) framework was applied to analyze the sustainability impacts of agroforestry residues (AFRs) across various scenarios, focusing on contributions to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at global and regional levels.

Repository Structure

1. IAES_SDG_Quantify

This directory includes the R scripts used for the quantitative analysis of the IAES framework. The code here runs the core calculations of the study, evaluating the potential impacts of AFR deployment on SDGs.

2. results_Visualization

This directory contains R scripts designed for visualizing the research results. These scripts produce the graphical outputs, including figures and charts, representing IAES impacts on sustainability metrics across different scenarios and regions.

3. data

The data directory (in compressed format) includes all the datasets used in this study. This collection encompasses input parameters, scenario-based data, and results data used for modeling and visualization. The datasets here are integral for reproducing the quantitative results presented in the study.

Usage

Run Quantitative Analysis: Start with the IAES_SDG_Quantify scripts to reproduce the core calculations of the IAES framework.
Generate Visualizations: Use the results_Visualization scripts to recreate the visual representations of the studyâ€™s findings.
Data Access: The data folder provides all necessary input data. Unzip the folder and ensure the correct file paths in the R scripts for seamless data access.

Notes

Ensure that all dependencies and packages required by the R scripts are installed.
